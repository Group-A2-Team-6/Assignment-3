# Assignment-3
1	BASE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TEAM PROFILE
1.1	Personal Information
Damian Dousset – S3755544
Nationality: Australian with Irish, Scottish, French and English heritage. 
Hobbies: During my limited down time when I am not working, studying, helping raise our 3 children or coaching my children’s’ soccer teams I enjoy building wooden model ships, kayaking, camping and fishing.
I am interested in IT because I believe that it is an important subject to grasp moving into the future due to speed with which technology is influencing our work and private lives. On a more personal note I am excited by the prospects that AR, VR, robotics and AI offer to the future in the way we conduct business and are entertained.
When it comes to IT experience, I have always managed to understand the basics enough to get me by, from downloading and installing games, creating spreadsheets, regular use of excel and Microsoft word and occasionally PowerPoint.

Shane Gillespie – S3807290
My name is Shane. I’m in my first year of studies towards a Bachelor’s in IT, with my areas of interest being cybersecurity and cloud computing. I enjoy spending my time reading and teaching myself new things.
My IT experience currently consists of me trying to teach myself some basic coding in my spare time, however I look forward to increasing my knowledge as I progress in my studies.

Andrew Fraser – S3666690
I am an Australian citizen living in Brisbane who works as a Supply Chain Manager for a Marine Construction company conducting projects around the world. I have worked around Australia, in Indonesia, Singapore, Egypt, Nigeria, Belgium and Germany. 
I am studying a Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management which I begun in mid-2016 and am in my final few units. In SP4 2019 I enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology as an elective, but was informed from student services that this unit was too similar to another compulsory unit and that if completed, I would not receive credit for IIT. Happily, the compulsory unit is not available until 2021 and IIT is the substitute unit! 
Outside of work and study I am a novice powerlifter who was preparing for my first sanctioned meet in Sydney in May, which unfortunately looks like it will be cancelled.
My interest in IT was sparked as a teenager, through video games, and then again through the course of my career, having witnessed the growing capabilities and usage of IoT, among others, in industry. Particularly clear to me is the moment our Manager Director sent through the profiles of two IoT companies with the message “Find a useful application of these platforms on your project and report back to me”.
My experience in IT is reasonably limited, stemming from learning in studies and everyday professional activities. I am a competent user of the basic Office suite, have taken part in development of our proprietary ERP, entirely as a key user, and am a user of other data platforms, such as Power BI. 
I chose to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology due to the major they offered, Logistics and Supply Chain Management. My choices at the time through distance learning was the Diploma to Professional Diploma pathway through the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, a Bachelor of Business through RMIT, Griffith or UniSA, or the Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management with RMIT. Due to the delivery method, specificity, learning pathways and career opportunities I decided upon RMIT and have never regretted the choice. 
During the Introduction to Information Technology unit I expect to garner cursory knowledge about useful platforms and applications of IT. I still have one elective unit to complete and I seek to select a unit outside of my typical knowledge-base while still learning something with relevancy to my chosen occupation. Not having any experience with programming, my initial goal is to learn about the uses of programming, abilities and capabilities of different programming languages, and to reflect upon the useful applications of programming languages in my everyday professional activities.

Adam Matthews – S3853376
I am a full-time student from Townsville, North Queensland who has moved to Brisbane for greater opportunities in the field of Information Technology, more specifically- Software Development. While I love all to do with computers, in my free time you will find me fishing, listening to music or intently following world sport, from Australian Rules Football to Formula 1 racing. A long term goal of mine is to one day be able to merge these pastimes with my fascination for software development in a professional setting.
My interest in the IT field is to be able contribute to technology in the fishing world, or be a part of a sports team or organisation that I have grown up loving. My fascination for software development sparked early in primary school when it was announced that there would be testing for North Queensland's first ever 'laptop class' in primary education. Having passed the test and been admitted into the class I was able to see in just two years how accessible and connected the world was becoming. Learning to create my first programs, and countless simple games afterwards, was where my interest truly flourished into fascination.

Jack Wilson – S3858813
My name is Jack Wilson and I am from South Gippsland, Victoria. I moved down to South Gippsland in 2013 from Melbourne where I had been living since, I was born. I finished Year 12 with a VCAL Certificate. I didn’t do VCE due to health reasons, but I still wanted to go to university. Back in February I found out about this course at Open Universities. I am now a fulltime student at RMIT University who is working online. I am working towards ultimately getting a master's degree in Computer Science.
Interest in IT: My main interest in IT revolves around studying and working with the latest technology. Given my various disabilities, I have always been interested in robotics, self-driving cars and other such technology that will allow me to lead a more independent life. 
Why did I choose to come to RMIT?: The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because it offered the best course options regarding IT. A qualification in this degree will give me a broader range of job opportunities. 
What did I expect to learn from my studies?: From my studies I was mainly hoping to obtain broad spectrum skills around IT, more specifically learning skills that revolve around all different areas of programming. 

1.2	Group Processes
From assignment 2 it was identified that we had no version control of our asssignment so for assignment 3 we placed greater importance on version control by utilising GitHub to a greater degree. This has allowed all members to store their work "off site", increase tracking of changes and an ability to revert to previous work if required. Also for assignment 2 communication was deemed to be an issue so, while planning for assignment 3, steps were proposed to help alleviate this issue by seeking out information from each member as to how often they think they would be able to make time to discuss the assignment and be available for video recording for assignent 5.

3.1	Overview
Topic – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)


Motivation – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)

Landscape – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)

3.2	Detailed Description
Aims – Shane (3-4 paragraphs)

Plans and Progress – Adam (2-4 pages)

Roles – Andrew (296 words)
Roles for the app’s development have been loosely assigned and are based around the potential hierarchy of a project. The roles have been assigned based on the aspirations and skills of the team members but are not fixed, nor do they wholly define the roles and jobs undertaken by each team member. The roles are as follows:
•	Project Manager – Damian Dousset
•	Lead Developer – Adam Matthews
•	Content, Marketing and Finance – Andrew Fraser
•	Developer – Shane Gillespie
•	Developer – Jack Wilson
Damian has been selected as the Project Manager. It is a role he naturally fills, instinctively developing structure, initiating brainstorming, and taking ownership over setting and meeting goals. Adam is the logical choice for Lead Developer as it is an evolved version of his initial project and maintains much of the original function and aim from that first concept. Pair this with his aim to be a software engineer for the Renault Formula 1 team and the position of Lead Developer for the project is an admirable position to fulfil and something he can add to his portfolio. Content, Marketing and Finance falls to Andrew Fraser, as he is completing his Bachelor of Business - Logistics and Supply Chain Management he has completed two finance units and one marketing unit. Although in the long run these two functions may be outsourced or conducted by new hires, his knowledge in these areas will give the project a running start. His primary responsibilities, outside of coding and development, will be seeking commercial partnerships and forming key strategic relationships. Shane Gillespie and Jack Wilson will take on Developer roles, primarily involved with creation of the app under the direction of the Lead Developer. This includes involvement with creating applications and functions processes, improvements, maintenance and programming, as do all the other roles.
Scope and Limits – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
The objective of this project is to create a fishing app with the capability for users to identify ideal fishing spots through the input of other users who have created a sort of tag at the location which marks the location with some input data through set filtered fields. The scope for the project has been defined as creating the user interface, the interface with Open Street Maps, the updated maps, the user chat, the contact interface between Service Provider and user, the reporting function for the social responsibilities aspect, and the “report a problem” function between users and developers.
To avoid “scope creep” it is important to also define what aspects of the application will not be within the scope for development. The map will not be created; Open Street Maps is an api available for all developers and is an evolving map of the world (cite). Already a lot of mobile applications offer the ability to link google, facebook or other social media accounts to the applications user account. This is offered through the (XX function) (cite) and as such this function is not within the scope for development. Information filters will be used in the application, the development team will use (XX function) (cite) which is available to all developers.
