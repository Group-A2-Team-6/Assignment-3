1	BASE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TEAM PROFILE
1.1	Personal Information
Damian Dousset – S3755544
Nationality: Australian with Irish, Scottish, French and English heritage. 
Hobbies: During my limited down time when I am not working, studying, helping raise our 3 children or coaching my children’s’ soccer teams I enjoy building wooden model ships, kayaking, camping and fishing.
I am interested in IT because I believe that it is an important subject to grasp moving into the future due to speed with which technology is influencing our work and private lives. On a more personal note I am excited by the prospects that AR, VR, robotics and AI offer to the future in the way we conduct business and are entertained.
When it comes to IT experience, I have always managed to understand the basics enough to get me by, from downloading and installing games, creating spreadsheets, regular use of excel and Microsoft word and occasionally PowerPoint.

Shane Gillespie – S3807290
My name is Shane. I’m in my first year of studies towards a Bachelor’s in IT, with my areas of interest being cybersecurity and cloud computing. I enjoy spending my time reading and teaching myself new things.
My IT experience currently consists of me trying to teach myself some basic coding in my spare time, however I look forward to increasing my knowledge as I progress in my studies.

Andrew Fraser – S3666690
I am an Australian citizen living in Brisbane who works as a Supply Chain Manager for a Marine Construction company conducting projects around the world. I have worked around Australia, in Indonesia, Singapore, Egypt, Nigeria, Belgium and Germany. 
I am studying a Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management which I begun in mid-2016 and am in my final few units. In SP4 2019 I enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology as an elective, but was informed from student services that this unit was too similar to another compulsory unit and that if completed, I would not receive credit for IIT. Happily, the compulsory unit is not available until 2021 and IIT is the substitute unit! 
Outside of work and study I am a novice powerlifter who was preparing for my first sanctioned meet in Sydney in May, which unfortunately looks like it will be cancelled.
My interest in IT was sparked as a teenager, through video games, and then again through the course of my career, having witnessed the growing capabilities and usage of IoT, among others, in industry. Particularly clear to me is the moment our Manager Director sent through the profiles of two IoT companies with the message “Find a useful application of these platforms on your project and report back to me”.
My experience in IT is reasonably limited, stemming from learning in studies and everyday professional activities. I am a competent user of the basic Office suite, have taken part in development of our proprietary ERP, entirely as a key user, and am a user of other data platforms, such as Power BI. 
I chose to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology due to the major they offered, Logistics and Supply Chain Management. My choices at the time through distance learning was the Diploma to Professional Diploma pathway through the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, a Bachelor of Business through RMIT, Griffith or UniSA, or the Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management with RMIT. Due to the delivery method, specificity, learning pathways and career opportunities I decided upon RMIT and have never regretted the choice. 
During the Introduction to Information Technology unit I expect to garner cursory knowledge about useful platforms and applications of IT. I still have one elective unit to complete and I seek to select a unit outside of my typical knowledge-base while still learning something with relevancy to my chosen occupation. Not having any experience with programming, my initial goal is to learn about the uses of programming, abilities and capabilities of different programming languages, and to reflect upon the useful applications of programming languages in my everyday professional activities.

Adam Matthews – S3853376
I am a full-time student from Townsville, North Queensland who has moved to Brisbane for greater opportunities in the field of Information Technology, more specifically- Software Development. While I love all to do with computers, in my free time you will find me fishing, listening to music or intently following world sport, from Australian Rules Football to Formula 1 racing. A long term goal of mine is to one day be able to merge these pastimes with my fascination for software development in a professional setting.
My interest in the IT field is to be able contribute to technology in the fishing world, or be a part of a sports team or organisation that I have grown up loving. My fascination for software development sparked early in primary school when it was announced that there would be testing for North Queensland's first ever 'laptop class' in primary education. Having passed the test and been admitted into the class I was able to see in just two years how accessible and connected the world was becoming. Learning to create my first programs, and countless simple games afterwards, was where my interest truly flourished into fascination.

Jack Wilson – S3858813
My name is Jack Wilson and I am from South Gippsland, Victoria. I moved down to South Gippsland in 2013 from Melbourne where I had been living since, I was born. I finished Year 12 with a VCAL Certificate. I didn’t do VCE due to health reasons, but I still wanted to go to university. Back in February I found out about this course at Open Universities. I am now a fulltime student at RMIT University who is working online. I am working towards ultimately getting a master's degree in Computer Science.
Interest in IT: My main interest in IT revolves around studying and working with the latest technology. Given my various disabilities, I have always been interested in robotics, self-driving cars and other such technology that will allow me to lead a more independent life. 
Why did I choose to come to RMIT?: The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because it offered the best course options regarding IT. A qualification in this degree will give me a broader range of job opportunities. 
What did I expect to learn from my studies?: From my studies I was mainly hoping to obtain broad spectrum skills around IT, more specifically learning skills that revolve around all different areas of programming. 

1.2	Group Processes
From assignment 2 it was identified that we had no version control of our asssignment so for assignment 3 we placed greater importance on version control by utilising GitHub to a greater degree. This has allowed all members to store their work "off site", increase tracking of changes and an ability to revert to previous work if required. Also for assignment 2 communication was deemed to be an issue so, while planning for assignment 3, steps were proposed to help alleviate this issue by seeking out information from each member as to how often they think they would be able to make time to discuss the assignment and be available for video recording for assignent 5.

1.3	Career Plans
Jack-

Damian-
Position: 
Financial Planner/ Investment Analyst
Although this career path is a far cry from my current employment, I feel over time I have acquired some of the skills necessary for a financial firm such as setting goals, meeting deadlines, communicating with others, oral and written skills, multitasking etc. These skills, coupled with a natural interest in finance, a mathematically driven mind, and an eagerness to learn more about the finance field, make employment in the finance sector a natural choice.
Working in a large firm would likely require working in the CBD so ideally Brisbane or Sydney would be my ideal preferences with a small commute to work each day. With my current employment requiring routine and discipline I wouldn’t find it excessively different from that expected of a large finance corporation. 
Although a change in career path at this stage would mean a drop in salary, by the time I switch jobs my wife will be back at work and all 3 children will be at school meaning we will be back on a dual income.
I am currently half way through my Bachelor of Business Degree. The next half of the degree will take approximately another 3.5 years which will align with our youngest daughter starting kindergarten and my wife resuming full-time employment. Once I have finished my degree, and before I leave my current job I will seek out a Graduate investment analyst/ financial planner position where post grad experience in the field is desirable but not essential. Along with my business degree it will also be beneficial for me to have some experience with Microsoft Excel, so, unless already gained through my degree, I will also undertake an Excel course to brush up on my skills. Also, prior financially modelling experience is also often a requirement in the investment analyst field so I should also consider taking an additional subject that will give me this experience.

3	PROJECT
3.1	Overview
Topic – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)
The purpose of this project is to create a mobile based fishing app targeted at recreational fishermen for both IOS and Android systems and will be limited to Australian states and territories. The app will drive a social atmosphere and will include the ability to share photos and chat about fishing. 
The aim of the app is to increase the popularity of recreational fishing in Australia, make recreational fishing more socially oriented and, through sustainability and waste recovery, support the health of Australian waterways to ensure recreational fishing is kept alive well into the Australia’s future.
While also incorporating data from weather and tidal apps, the app will also be driven by data uploaded by recreational fishers in regards to what types of fish are caught in different locations, the best tide times when the fish have been caught and even recommended bait or tackle configurations.


Motivation – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)
There are 3 main motivations behind the project in bringing technology to the sport of fishing. The first of which is to make the sport become more socially focused, by linking various social media platforms to the app. The second is to increase fishing as a popular pastime by making successful fishing spots, methods, gear and times more established, especially beneficial in getting recreational fishers to take up the sport. The third reason for the push for technology is to collect and make data from the app available to assorted Australian agencies for the purpose of stocking of fish in certain areas based on the popularity, to the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in order to gain an insight into fish populations and migrations over a long period of time, and to local governments for the purpose of the recovery of waste such as chemical drums, car tires and whitegoods from Australia’s water ways. 
The current IT trends include the increase of mobile technology and the popularity of social media in the day-to-day lives of Australians. Technology is especially relevant to the sport of recreational fishing where fishers need to: use maps to search for fishing spots, google where to purchase bait and fishing equipment, purchase a fishing license depending on which state they live in, check to see what the weather and tides are like, look for tips on how to catch certain species of fish, and many other reasons. 
To work on this project would show to a future employer that we as individuals are able to both undertake individual research on a set topic and also work together as a group to compile a report while having an understanding of relevant IT software and methods.


Landscape – Damian (1-2 paragraphs)
There are numerous stand-alone apps on the market for fishing related activities including: Social media, tides, weather, maps, lunar calendars, fish identification, fishing knots and many others.
There are about 10 competitors in the market, the most popular of which, Fishbrain, has over 5 million users worldwide. With the most popular Australian apps having about 100,000 free and 10,000 subscribed users. 
The main competitors for the app would be Fishbrain and Australian based apps: “Fishing points- Fishing app” and “Fishing spots”. These apps all feature similar functions such as: a map indicating where fish have been caught, a social media feed, a weather forecast, the ability to upload a catch, a fish species database and a virtual tacklebox. 
This app differs from the current apps due to the environmental and sustainable elements that no other apps currently offer, with the ability to report dumping and providing data to government agencies for sustainability. Additionally, what will set the app apart is ease of use, functionality and ability to link seamlessly with a wide range of social media platforms. The app will also be able to digitally hold current state drivers licences, fishing licences and marine licences and will also show the closest fishing tackle/ bait suppliers and operating hours something that the other apps don't do. 
 
 



3.2	Detailed Description
Aims – Shane (3-4 paragraphs)


Plans and Progress – Adam (2-4 pages)
At its most basic level, iCatch is a smartphone app that will assist recreational fishermen in a number of ways. The application will take an accessible and easily manageable form and allow users to; mark fishing spots by location and store relevant data, connect with friends and fishing professionals, and suggest new locations for users based on collected data and the users’ chosen fishing method. Additionally, the app will include the ability for recreational fishers to report illegal dumping such as car tires and white goods so often seen in water ways during fishing.  
One feature of the app will allow users to mark specific locations via GPS and gather information that will again be made accessible to the consumer in a well presented and user-friendly manner. This information will be gathered automatically by the program from various websites and data agencies. The data that will be collected by the program will include; the location of fish where they are caught, the tide (and its size), water temperature, currents, time of day and weather conditions, and countless more relevant variables. Data that cannot be collected automatically will require user inputs and will incorporate; the type (and size) of fish, the tackle use, how accessible the location is, water depth, as well as the depth where the fish hit the line. Other data supported by the app will be things such as dates and pictures.
Rather than just storing the data, this program will then feed it back to the user based on specified filters or smart suggestions. This could work two ways. Firstly, by allowing the user to search for a specific fish. This will return various locations within a certain radius (specified by the user) where these fish have been caught in volumes. Preferred bait, optimal tides (when they feed in the cycle, incoming or outgoing, etc.) and most successful tackle will all be returned to the user to give them the best chance of catching their target fish. Secondly, a user could instead choose to enter a location, rather than a target fish. This would then return what fish are likely to be caught at that spot, all while taking into account the weather, time of day, and season.
Another feature that we have considered is adding a social aspect to the application. This would allow users to follow friends or public figures allowing them to share locations, catches and discuss with each-other. This would also allow existing fishing charters to charge subscription fees for information such as fishing spots and tips through our application.  
the ability to supply captured data to the Department of primary industries and the CSIRO for fish migration data and Australian state agencies for the purpose of fish stocking programs.
Initially the app will be built for IOS and Android devices. This means there are a number of necessary tools and technologies required to build and accommodate the program. The software required to build the IOS app includes the Apple Xcode toolkit. For the Android app, programs such as Android Studio or Eclipse are needed. The data collected by the app will be centralised as we aim make the most of cloud computing, limiting requirements on the consumer end. The hardware requirements are, as a minimum, a device capable of comfortably running software development kits.
The skills required by the team to build and maintain the application are great competence in both Swift and Java programming languages. Furthermore, strong skills with various aspects of cloud computing are also necessary. More specifically, database skills and developmental operations proficiency.
Fishing remains relatively untouched by the growing world of mobile technology. As there are an estimated five-million people in Australia alone who participate in recreational fishing (Statistics, 2003), we view this application as a great opportunity to bring a traditionally primitive hobby into the modern world of technology, all the while accessing a new market in app development.
Ideally, this project will become an essential tool for all people who love to fish recreationally, such will be the value of the information gathered. Not only will it advance the understanding of experienced anglers, but it will give confidence to those who are willing to start.

Roles – Andrew (296 words)
Roles for the app’s development have been loosely assigned and are based around the potential hierarchy of a project. The roles have been assigned based on the aspirations and skills of the team members but are not fixed, nor do they wholly define the roles and jobs undertaken by each team member. The roles are as follows:
•	Project Manager – Damian Dousset
•	Lead Developer – Adam Matthews
•	Content, Marketing and Finance – Andrew Fraser
•	Developer – Shane Gillespie
•	Developer – Jack Wilson
Damian has been selected as the Project Manager. It is a role he naturally fills, instinctively developing structure, initiating brainstorming, and taking ownership over setting and meeting goals. Adam is the logical choice for Lead Developer as it is an evolved version of his initial project and maintains much of the original function and aim from that first concept. Pair this with his aim to be a software engineer for the Renault Formula 1 team and the position of Lead Developer for the project is an admirable position to fulfil and something he can add to his portfolio. Content, Marketing and Finance falls to Andrew Fraser, as he is completing his Bachelor of Business - Logistics and Supply Chain Management he has completed two finance units and one marketing unit. Although in the long run these two functions may be outsourced or conducted by new hires, his knowledge in these areas will give the project a running start. His primary responsibilities, outside of coding and development, will be seeking commercial partnerships and forming key strategic relationships. Shane Gillespie and Jack Wilson will take on Developer roles, primarily involved with creation of the app under the direction of the Lead Developer. This includes involvement with creating applications and functions processes, improvements, maintenance and programming, as do all the other roles.

Scope and Limits – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
The objective of this project is to create a fishing app with the capability for users to identify ideal fishing spots through the input of other users who have created a sort of tag at the location which marks the location with some input data through set filtered fields. The scope for the project has been defined as creating the user interface, the interface with Open Street Maps, the updated maps, the user chat, the contact interface between Service Provider and user, the reporting function for the social responsibilities aspect, and the “report a problem” function between users and developers.
To avoid “scope creep” it is important to also define what aspects of the application will not be within the scope for development. The map will not be created; Open Street Maps is an api available for all developers and is an evolving map of the world (cite). Already a lot of mobile applications offer the ability to link google, facebook or other social media accounts to the applications user account. This is offered through the (XX function) (cite) and as such this function is not within the scope for development. Information filters will be used in the application, the development team will use (XX function) (cite) which is available to all developers.

Tools and Technologies – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
Typically apps for different operating systems require different programming languages. In most circumstances those languages are Java and C++ for Android and Swift and Objective C for iOS. As none of the group members are particularly skilled or experienced with any programming languages, it is in the best interests of the project to adopt lean principles for the human resources and maximise efficiency of effort. As such the project will adopt the source code app user interface Xamarin.FORMS, which allows users to create applications for both Android and iOS using C# as the programming language (Microsoft 2020) (G2 2020), and bridges gaps using the platforms existing protocols. Pricing for an enterprise is $1,899 USD for one year’s license (G2 2020).
Additionally there will be a number of .api’s required for such app functions as filters, etc. although these will likely be recruited from open source code to reduce the amount of original content creation. If licenses are required for access to source libraries this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis through a needs analysis.

Testing – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
Testing is a critical component in app creation to ensure that the logic and the process flows translate correctly to the manifested app. Each function should be tested on an Android and iOS platform to guarantee that users can immediately enjoy the full use of the app upon release without conflicts or errors. However with limited resources and limited time, user testing after each additional function to determine the impact on all existing applications is a very time-consuming process. Therefore testing will be conducted for new functions as the app is developed through a process of “builds”, beginning with v0.1.
User testers will be selected from the project team as well as an additional 2-5 testers from outside of the project team. The testers will be selected on the basis of development knowledge and experience, along with the type of mobile device the tester owns. For the maximum exposure as broad a spread as possible of popular brands should be covered, including brands such as Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Nokia, Sony, Google and OnePlus. A higher level of app or programming expertise to thoroughly assist with useful feedback. Fishing interest is a minor factor as content creation is the responsibility of the project team and the scope and available resources do not allow for further function or content to be developed prior to release. Post-release, depending on how well the app functions, feedback and interest, further development can be considered, further resources assigned and the testing program expanded accordingly.

Consumer testing & feedback

Continuous improvement



Time-frame – Andrew (1-2 paragraphs + plus table)
The project has been in progress for nearly 6 weeks by the publishing of this report and progress has been solid. In the early weeks the team was given easily achievable goals, whereby the individual members could reset from the build-up of stress from assignment 2. During this time the main focus was on the app layout and mock-ups were produced by Damian, with review and feedback from the other group members. Weeks 4-6 heavily focused on the presentation script, presentation filming and making decent strides into the report progress.

Weeks 7-16 of the project timeline will be heavily focused towards app development; programming, testing builds, and creating the sought-after commercial partners. An abbreviated timeline can be seen below:





Risks – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
The project objectives are at the far end of ambitious, to the point they project can absorb very few delays to maintain the project timeline. Within this time the Xamarin.FORMS platform must be secured, the application programmed using a programming language none of the project members have experience with, use of a few unfamiliar .api’s to facilitate projected functions, and the integration with Open Street Maps created in addition to forming strategic partnerships with service providers in the industry. 
Difficulties in licensing the necessary source code interface, learning the programming language, failures of the source code to provide the expected benefit or delays in securing strategic partnerships can all result in delays of the deliverables and potential delays to the overall project. A delay in the project may result in a loss in investor confidence, or a loss in the consumer interest, in addition to the potential to higher with overheads costs and jeopardise the budget.
Recruiting the appropriate testers may be a risk. There are little resources to incentivise testers and therefore engendering sufficient buy-in from the ideal testers may be problematic. At worst case this may also create a delay in the project delivery, or result in unexpected errors after app launch resulting from conflicts which should have been detected and rectified during the testing. This may impact the reputation and therefore the overall success of the project.


Group Processes and Communications – Andrew (1-2 paragraph)
Group communication was solid through assignment 2 although, as always, with some room for improvement. Microsoft Teams group chat is the main communication platform as it is the most versatile. Teams can be operated as a web or mobile app and is designed as a commercial work platform and therefore allows file storage, meeting planning, and voice and video meetings and conferences. Zoom was also used for the rehearsal and recording of the group presentation, although these sessions were scheduled using Teams. The presentation would have also been conducted through Teams, however Zooms in-built recording functionality made the need for an additional recording program, such as OBS, redundant.
No formal meetings were scheduled, outside of the presentation rehearsals and recording, due to time-zone differences and availabilities of the individual group members. Collaboration and brainstorming was conducted more informally through Teams group chat.
Allocation of work was divided on a voluntarily basis, assuming correctly that individual responsibility would encourage members to volunteer for sections with a relatively fair division. To a surprising degree this method was successful, although some group members did take on a greater workload, dividing up outstanding sections among the more organised group members. Work allocation was divided and recorded using a Gantt chart in excel, with an approximate workload and duration included to assist in a fair division. The Gantt chart can be observed below.

In addition Github was used a lot more for file and version storage by the group after recommendation in the feedback from Assignment 2. A new repository for Assignment 3 was created and all shared files were stored in Github. However, one member working on location had his personal laptop destroyed when a tree fell through the house in a storm on the weekend Assignment 2 was due. As such all shared files were also stored on Teams to ensure all members had easy access, although this required discipline in communication to ensure the integrity of version control was maintained.

5	REFLECTION
5.1	Damian
Test

5.2	Shane

5.3	Andrew
Most group members at this late stage of the unit have a reasonable report and level of understanding. Therefore the forward thinking and collaboration between group members was very positive. Each active group member took initiative at certain points to take upon themselves work that bettered the overall product. For example, Damian took the presentation upon himself early and without seeking advice he produced quite a good product, seeking group feedback when the task was mostly completed.
Use of Git repository could be improved. Because of familiarity and the ease of Teams group chat, it was maintained as the collaboration and file sharing platform. However, after feedback from Assignment 2 it was determined by the group to promote Github utilisation, leading to significant duplication of effort which potentially endangered the integrity of the repositories version control with the same files stored and updated in two locations. Unfortunately this was more or less unavoidable, with one member unable to use Git through unforeseen circumstances.
The drop off of buy-in from some group members at this late stage of the unit was surprising. A significant drop in participation was noted from one group member in particular, which was disappointing to see. However, the assignment delivery was never in question thanks to the forethought and planning of the active group members.

5.6	Group Reflection 
Overall as a group the two assignments were very successful. Having a more mature aggregate may have played a part with that but the line between individual responsibility and team cohesion integrated to great effect. Many group members stepped up to take overload from members that were struggling for various reasons in pursuit of the overall team objectives. Unfortunately, due to turbulent global and national circumstances, there have been significant disturbances to group members personal lives, which has impacted their ability to focus on the group project. 
On the whole the group communication has been quite solid. Individuals did not feel the need to broadcast every action they take towards their tasks, but the communication was relevant, frequent, informative, and collaborative. The overall use of Github repository could have been improved, as it is a project requirement and the version control features are useful. However, unforeseen circumstances would have forced a work-around for one member, and therefore the flexibility and ease-of-use Microsoft Teams was retained for Assignment 3.
Surprisingly, despite the horrible reputation of group work, working with this Team has been an altogether pleasant experience. In most circumstances the work has been distributed relatively evenly, responsibility taken up be each group member and the work completed in good time, with no last minute rush to submit or penalties resulting from late submissions. Although the take-away for each group member is that in future groups, assigning early section deadlines allows for a buffer to take up any slack that arises or to complete any troubleshooting of issues , such as formatting on the website.
